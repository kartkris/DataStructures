# DataStructures
This repository contains implementations of various data structures in the following languages:
* Python
* Go
* Rust  
* Zig 

This should serve to understand the data structures and by implementing in these languages should serve to 
learn these languages as well.

These code samples have been written following the youtube videos of freecodecamp.org channel's "Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer" 
and can be accessed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM


[Note: I'm working on a plan to maintain implementations in respective branches, with master serving as reference]

Rust and Zig should be ideal end candidates.
